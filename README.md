# Text-Classification-Dataset-and-Fine-Tuning-with-Pretrained-Language-Model

**Project Overview:**
Created a custom text classification dataset, split it into training and test sets, and fine-tuned a pretrained language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Key milestones include:

**Dataset Creation:**

Developed a text classification dataset with a minimum of 1000 words, comprising at least two categories.
Ensured each category had at least 100 examples, providing diversity in the dataset.
Data collection methods may include web scraping or using non-confidential documents.

**Dataset Split:**

Split the dataset into training (at least 160 examples) and test (at least 40 examples) sets.
Maintained a balance between the categories in both training and test sets.

**Fine-Tuning with Pretrained Language Model:**

Leveraged a pretrained language model, such as GPT, from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Followed the provided tutorial (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) for fine-tuning the model on the custom dataset.

**Test Accuracy Reporting:**

Reported the test accuracy achieved by the fine-tuned language model.

Discussion on Improvements:

Explored potential avenues to enhance accuracy, such as:
Increasing the size and diversity of the dataset.
Experimenting with different pretrained models or architectures.
Tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
Incorporating more advanced techniques like data augmentation or ensemble models.
This project highlights skills in dataset creation, data splitting, and fine-tuning pretrained language models for text classification. The discussion on potential improvements demonstrates a critical analysis of the model's performance and suggests avenues for further optimization.
